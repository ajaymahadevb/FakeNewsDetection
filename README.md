# 📰 Fake News Detection  

This project implements a **Fake News Detection system** using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP).  
The goal is to classify news articles as **Real** or **Fake**, helping in combating misinformation.  

All the experiments were developed in **Google Colab**, and the repository includes both the notebook and a Python script version.
